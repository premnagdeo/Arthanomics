                    <p>‘Volunteering is an Attitude, not an Action.’ <br><br>

                        In The Artha Series Episode 1, Arthanomics hosted a live session with Trishya Screwvala, Founder
                        of The Lighthouse Project- a Mumbai based not-for-profit organisation connecting working
                        professionals and college students with children from under resourced communities, through
                        one-on-one mentoring in a safe environment. In this extremely inspiring session, Trishya talked
                        about the noble cause that is volunteering and it’s absolute importance. <br><br>

                        Wanting to come up with a platform that channelled the energy, the intention and the very skills
                        today’s generation has, along with their want to ‘give back’ attitude, and at the same time
                        being feasible for those willing to volunteer, Trishya started The Lighthouse Project in 2013,
                        that has since changed the course of volunteering in India!The plan of action, being a
                        one-on-one mentoring programme, has turned out to be extremely effective, building a positive
                        and nurturing relationship between the mentors and their respective mentees. <br><br>

                        According to Trishya, in today’s bustling life, volunteering is like a breath of fresh air as it
                        pushes one to keep aside all their problems and limitations that are forever present, and bring
                        in their A game; their best version possible! The viewers were given a new direction, a renewed
                        perspective on the importance of volunteering and the path they could choose. <br><br>

                        Needless to say, it was quite an insightful experience! <br><br>

                        understanding of Anxiety Issues as well as Depression-their signs, causes and how to overcome
                        them in a detailed and well explained manner.
                        In a very interactive and interesting session, Zohra and Yogita managed to engage every

                    <p>In the Artha Series Episode 3, Arthanomics hosted a live session with Amaan Jhaveri, Aditya
                        Somani and Rohan Somani, Founders of The Heritage Fabrics Company-a South Bombay based startup,
                        offering millennials a reimagined and iconic collection of everyday looks. They are young
                        entrepreneurs looking to dent the world of fashion, adhering to their motto- "Think of the
                        present, age is just a number!” <br><br>
                        They advocated that it is imperative for one to strike a balance between their academic and
                        entrepreneurial endeavours so that they can be proactive in their business while ensuring their
                        personal growth.
                        When asked how they dealt with competition, they emphasised on the importance of being unique
                        and different in the value one creates, believing that their customisation process, response to
                        feedback and price point helps them stand out! They also greatly advocate eco friendly products
                        and believe in ethical consciousness to be a huge contributing factor to brand building.
                        <br><br>
                        Their advice to budding young entrepreneurs is- "Start somewhere! There are many reasons to not
                        do something you love- but be prepared to face them with your grit, tenacity and determination
                        to reach success! Always remember to back yourself, because unless you don't, nobody else will."

                        presentation, they were all set to go! <br><br>
                        During the webinar there was a meticulous explanation of what political polarisation means and
                        how, in every aspect of our lives- be it marriage or citizenship to simply our attire- politics,
                        or simply the policies made by political leaders, affects our every move, every decision!
                        Further, viewers learnt how the process of dividing the society into poles works and how very
                        common it is all around the globe. Backed by facts and examples, Sarah and Natasha explained how
                        media- from news channels to social media platforms like twitter- aim to influence and micro
                        target individuals to lean towards a particular direction- an eye opener indeed! <br><br>
                        They concluded by discussing ways of how we can help break the chain of misinformation, widen
                        our perspectives and keep ourselves poles away only from one thing- dirty politics!
